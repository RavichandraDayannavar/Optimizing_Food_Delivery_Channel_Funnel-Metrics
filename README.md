## Optimizing_Food_Delivery_Channel_Funnel-Metrics

This project delves into Swiggy's 2019 performance metrics using three datasets to uncover trends in user behavior, traffic sources, and operational efficiency. The analysis provides actionable insights for improving funnel conversions and customer experience.

Datasets Used: 

1. Session Details
Includes daily metrics for listing, menu, cart, payment, and order sessions.
2. Channel-wise Traffic
Breaks down listing session traffic by source (organic, referral, paid).
3. Supporting Data
Operational metrics like average discount, out-of-stock items, payment success rates, and cost factors.

Key Questions Addressed: 
- What are the conversion rates across funnel stages (L2M, M2C, C2P, P20)?
- How do traffic sources influence overall session trends and conversions?
- What operational metrics impact customer satisfaction, such as delivery and packaging charges?
- What are the weekly trends in sessions and orders?
